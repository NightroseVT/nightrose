## Files
- index.html: The main HTML structure of your website
- index.css: All styling for your website

## Hosting and domains
I reccomend hosting on Github pages, tutorial here:
https://pages.github.com/

you can even use a custom domain (aka url) by following this tutorial:
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

to get a custom domain I reccomend namecheap:
https://ap.www.namecheap.com

## Customization
To further customize your website, you can edit the HTML, CSS, and JS files directly.

## Additional info
There's nothing stopping you from removing the footer, but it will make me sad :_(
